Q6.Explain the difference between the RequestDispatcher.forward() and HttpServletResponse.sendRedirect() methods?



ANSWER:


The `RequestDispatcher.forward()` and `HttpServletResponse.sendRedirect()` methods are both used for redirecting requests in a Java servlet. However, they differ in how they handle the redirection and the subsequent flow of control. Here are the main differences between the two methods:

1. Flow of Control:
   - `RequestDispatcher.forward()`:
     - This method forwards the request and response objects from one servlet to another servlet or JSP page within the same server-side request.
     - The flow of control is transferred to the target servlet or JSP page, and the processing continues from there.
     - The target servlet or JSP page can access the request and response objects and can modify or append to the response generated by the original servlet.
     - The client is not aware that the request has been forwarded, as the URL in the browser's address bar does not change.
   - `HttpServletResponse.sendRedirect()`:
     - This method sends a response to the client with a new URL to which the client should send a subsequent request.
     - The client receives the response and performs a new request to the specified URL.
     - The flow of control is completely transferred to the new URL, and any further processing in the original servlet is stopped.
     - The client's browser will display the new URL in the address bar.

2. Browser Behavior:
   - `RequestDispatcher.forward()`:
     - The browser is not involved in the forwarding process. It is unaware of the server-side forwarding and still maintains the original URL in the address bar.
     - Any relative URLs in the forwarded page are resolved relative to the original URL.
   - `HttpServletResponse.sendRedirect()`:
     - The browser receives a response with a new URL and performs a new request to that URL.
     - The new URL is visible in the browser's address bar, and subsequent requests are made to the new URL.
     - Any relative URLs in the redirected page are resolved relative to the new URL.

3. Data Preservation:
   - `RequestDispatcher.forward()`:
     - The request and response objects are forwarded as they are to the target servlet or JSP page.
     - Any request attributes, request parameters, or session attributes set in the original servlet are accessible in the target servlet or JSP page.
   - `HttpServletResponse.sendRedirect()`:
     - The request and response objects are not forwarded to the new URL. Instead, a completely new request and response are created.
     - Any request attributes, request parameters, or session attributes set in the original servlet are not accessible in the redirected page unless they are explicitly passed as query parameters or stored in the session.

In summary, `RequestDispatcher.forward()` is used to internally forward the request and response objects to another servlet or JSP page within the same server-side request, while `HttpServletResponse.sendRedirect()` is used to redirect the client to a new URL and trigger a new request. The choice between the two methods depends on the desired behavior, the need for data preservation, and the involvement of the client browser.
